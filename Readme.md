# TYPO3 Extension `rte_ckeditor_codesnippet`

| :warning: WARNING                                                                                     |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| There is no further development of this project because since TYPO3 v12 there is CKEditor v5 in use!  |

Extension is not needed anymore, because with TYPO3 v12 with CKEditor 5 you can use the Code Blocks module which you can configure in your own site package, example see here:
