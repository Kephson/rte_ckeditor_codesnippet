.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This extension ships a simple plugin for the CkEditor to allow editors to insert coding tags inside text elements.

The plugin itself has been taken from the `CKEditor Inserting Code Snippet documentation <https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/codesnippet.html>`_ without any changes.

At the moment it integrates the `plugin version 4.18.0 <https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippet>`_.

It suggests the extension `fs_code_snippet <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/fs_code_snippet>`_ to render the codesnippets in the frontend of your website.
